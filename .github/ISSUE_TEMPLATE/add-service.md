**What is the service?**
Please provide a name and link (if possible) to the service.

**Can you point to documented or published critiques of the service?**
Please reference existing sources; you'll be able to write your own critique for the final version, but documenting and citing existing resistance to each piece of tech is worthwhile to me.

**Any alternatives come to mind?**
You don't have to have an alternative in mind. It may be that the service is fundamentally harmful, and no alternative should (or even can) exist to replace it. Or it may be that an alternative should exist, but none currently does.
